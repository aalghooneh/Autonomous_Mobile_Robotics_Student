## Part 1: 20 marks (from the written content on the report)
- ```10``` if properly explained the stack and the relationship between all components;
- ```5``` if added schematics/block diagram as requested;
- ```5``` if properly connected with theoretical contents;
- ```1``` point deduction for exceeding word limit.

## Part 2: 25 marks + 5 marks bonus (from code submission)
- ```6``` if completed properly ```planning```;
- ```3``` if completed properly ```choose_parent```;
- ```4``` if completed properly ```rewire```;
- ```3``` if completed properly ```search_best_goal_node```;
- ```6``` if implemented properly integration into stack;
- ```3``` if implemented properly path smoothing.
- **Bonus** ```5``` if implemented integration with map (and delivered plot and video with the map).

## Part 3: 25 marks + 3 marks bonus (from code submission, written report, and video)
- ```8``` for using EKF and PID controllers properly;
- ```12``` for two goal points shown in plots;
- ```5``` for video(s) showing at least one successful run;
- **Bonus** ```3``` for logging and plotting the covariance ellipses.
- There is a deduction of ```1``` mark for each figure missing title, label, legend (when needed), and grid. There is a further deduction of ```1``` for each missing indication of start and goal poses, and ```1``` mark deduction for low-quality video (e.g. not recorded with a screen recorder).


## Conclusions - Report: 30 marks
**From Report on LEARN**
- ```1``` mark for names (Family Name, First Name); student ID.
- Section 2: 
   - ```7``` for properly describing the RRT* code and the implementation;
   - ```4``` for properly describing the integration into the stack, including path smoothing;
- Section 3:
   - ```6``` for proper discussion on the tuning process (e.g. report some of the values tried and why did you change them);
   - ```4``` for meaningful discussion on the overall performance of the implemented RRT*;
- Section 4:
   - ```8``` for meaningful discussion on the overall stack, including all parts of the stack combined.
- Deduction of ```1``` mark for each page exceeding the limit (appendix not included).
