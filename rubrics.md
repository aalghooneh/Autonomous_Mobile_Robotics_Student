## Part 1 and 2: No marks
## Part 3: 5 marks
**In-Lab**
- ```5/5``` if proper and good quality map shown, ```3/5``` if not good quality, ```0/5``` if no map shown.

## Part 4: 25 marks
**From Code Submission on LEARN:**
- ```5/5``` if proper initialization of star and end nodes and g, h, f, ```3/5``` if initialized but partially wrong, ```0/5``` if incomplete/completely wrong;
- ```3/3``` if correctly completed the movements, ```1.5/3``` if completed but partially wrong, ```0/3``` if incomplete/completely wrong.
- ```2/2``` if correctly completed the size of the maze, ```1/2``` if completed but partially wrong, ```0/2``` if incomplete/completely wrong.
- ```5/5``` if correctly completed the node position and checked that it is within boundaries ```2.5/5``` if completed but partially wrong, ```0/5``` if incomplete/completely wrong.
- ```10/10``` if correctly implemented the two specified two heuristics and properly completed the computation of the costs```5/10``` if completed one or two but partially wrong, ```0/10``` if incomplete/completely wrong.

## Part 5: 25 marks
**From Code Submission on LEARN**
- ```10/10``` if correctly implemented and completed the code in ```planner.py``` for the cost map, ```5/10``` if completed but partially wrong, ```0/10``` if incomplete/completely wrong.
- ```10/10``` if correctly implemented and completed the code in ```planner.py``` for the trajectory, ```5/10``` if completed but partially wrong, ```0/10``` if incomplete/completely wrong.
- ```5/5``` if correctly implemented and completed the code in ```decisions.py``` to adapt the code for the path planner, ```2.5/5``` if completed but partially wrong, ```0/5``` if incomplete/completely wrong.
- **Bonus** ```2.5``` marks for using PID gains from Lab2, ```2.5``` marks for using Q, R, P from Lab3 and EKF for the localizer.

## Part 6: 20 marks
**From Code and Report Submission on LEARN**
- ```5/5``` if two heuristics tested successfully, ```2.5/5``` if only one heuristic, ```0/5``` if none.

**In-Lab**
- ```10/10``` if shown at least two successful planned trajectories to two desired goal poses, ```5/10``` if showed only one trajectory, ```0/10``` if not shown.

## Conclusion - Report: 30 marks
**From Report on LEARN**
- ```1``` mark for names (Family Name, First Name); student IDs of all group members; station number (if known); and robot number.
- ```10/10``` for the proper and correct description of how the workflow of the code and the implementation, ```5/10``` if incomplete/insufficient explanation, ```0/10``` if missing/completely wrong.
- ```10/10``` for providing all required maps and figures (two goal poses, two heuristics), ```5/10``` if only provided partial results, ```0/10``` if no results provided. There is a deduction of ```1``` mark for each figure missing title, label, legend (when needed), and grid. There is further deduction of ```1``` for each missing indication of start and goal poses.
- ```9/9``` for discussion on the results obtained, ```5/9``` for incomplete/insufficient discussion, ```0/9``` for missing discussion.
- Deduction of ```1``` mark for each page exceeding the limit.
