## Part 1 and 2: No marks
## Part 3: 15 marks
**From Code Submission on LEARN:**
- ```6``` marks for correct completion of ```localization.py```: ```4/6``` for incorrect lines and ```1/6``` for non-sense  completion.
- ```6``` marks for correct completion of ```decision.py```: ```4/6``` for incorrect lines and ```1/6``` for non-sense  completion.
- ```3``` marks for correct completion of ```utilities.py```: ```2/3``` for incorrect lines and ```1/3``` for non-sense completion.
> 6 x 2 + 3 = 15 marks
## Part 4: 20 marks
**From Code Submission on LEARN:** 
- ```3``` marks for correct completion of ```pid.py```, ```utilities.py```, ```controller.py```, and, ```decision.py```.
> 3 x 4 = 12 marks
**In-Lab:** ```8``` marks for testing Point Controller

- If you did not show the motions in the lab to a TA, then you get ```4``` marks (50% off) if you have the plots in the report.

## Part 5: 20 marks
**From Report on LEARN:**
- ```10``` marks for plots with title, label name for axis, legends, different shapes/colors for each data, and grids.
- ```10``` marks for showing the tunning process.

## Part 6: 20 marks
**In-Lab: 20 marks**
- ```10``` marks for each trajectory: ```0``` for inexecutable code, ```5``` for incorrect motion, and ```8``` for jerky trajectories.
- If you did not show the motions in the lab to a TA, then you get ```5``` marks (50% off) for each trajectory shown in the plots in the report.

> 10 x 2 = 20
  
## Conclusions: 25 marks
**From Report on LEARN:**
- ```1``` mark for names (Family Name, First Name); student IDs; station number; and robot number of all group members.
- ```7``` marks for stability anyalsis of each controller (overshoot, oscillations, response time, etc.).
- ```10``` marks for dicussion (comparison between controllers in the light of parameters calculated in stability analysis).
